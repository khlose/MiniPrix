After experimenting with Robert's code found here
https://github.com/linhartr22/Arduino_SPI_Master_Slave_Demo/blob/master/SPI_Slave_Demo/SPI_Slave_Demo.ino
I tried setting up SPI on 9s12 and managed to send out stuff just fine! But there's a problem though. It seems like data sent
was messed up. In serial monitor it shows that I sent out several different chars (shown in ascii), while I only have putcspi('a')
I have absolutely no idea what happened, I don't know if it's from 9S12 or ATmega. It drove me crazy for quite a long time. Then it hits me

The problem here is the baud rate! code from 9S12 wasn't configured with the appropriate Baud Rate, causing data to be messed up on 
transmission line.

I don't know exactly what the value should be so I set up SPIBR to be 0x77 to max out divider and it works! now it only shows that I sent
out a byte with value 97 which is an 'a'. Now I will just have to  find the correct value for my baud rate

Here's a quick summary of how to do it properly.

1 ) set up SPI (Code sample in textbook, lab08)
2 ) Before transmission begins, make sure to toggle slave select line of the one that you want to talk with 
(SS to high = deselect, it's active low you dummy)
3 ) perform regular transmission
4 ) Toggle back SS line to high to deselect
5 ) Done, easy right?

Now that I can talk to one Arduino, let see if we can do two Slaves..... I will keep you up to date
